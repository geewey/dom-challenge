# The DOM Challenge

I built this small application during Flatiron School's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp while initially learning about JavaScript functionalities. It has a few features:

*   A Counter that increases by 1 each second
*   Plus and Minus buttons that increment or decrement the counter
*   A 'like' button (❤️) that adds a 'like' for the number that is currently displayed by the timer
*   A comment box that adds comments when submitted

As part of the practice, I had to explore and test out the behavior of a working, finished page to understand what is happening underneath each of these features. Note: the HTML framework was provided.

The challenge was to reverse engineer these features and build them myself, using what I learned in two days about JavaScript and DOM Manipulation.

## Rewriting the functionality

The deliverables for the practice are included below. They describe the features from the perspective of a user when they visit the page.

1.  As a user, I should see the timer increment every second once the page has loaded.
2.  As a user, I can manually increment and decrement the counter using the plus and minus buttons.
3.  As a user, I can 'like' an individual number of the counter. I should see count of the number of 'likes' associated with that number.
4.  As a user, I can pause the counter, which should
    *   pause the counter
    *   disable all buttons except the pause button
    *   the pause button should then show the text "resume."
    When 'resume' is clicked, it should restart the counter and re-enable the buttons.
5.  As a user, I can leave comments on my gameplay, such as: "Wow, what a fun game this is."
