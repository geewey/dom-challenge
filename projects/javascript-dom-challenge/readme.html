<h1>The DOM Challenge</h1>

<p>I built this small application inside as I learned about JavaScript in Flatiron School's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp. It has a few features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Counter that increases by 1 each second</li>
  <li>Plus and Minus buttons that increment or decrement the counter</li>
  <li>A 'like' button (❤️) that adds a 'like' for the number that is currently displayed by the timer</li>
  <li>A comment box that adds comments when submitted</li>
</ul>

<p>As part of the practice, I had to explore and test out the behavior of a working, finished page to understand what is happening underneath each of these features. Note: the HTML framework was provided.</p>

<p>The challenge was to reverse engineer these features and build them myself, using what I learned in two days about JavaScript and DOM Manipulation.</p>

<h2>Rewriting the functionality</h2>

<p>The deliverables for the practice are included below. They describe the features from the perspective of a user when they visit the page.</p>
<ol>
  <li>As a user, I should see the timer increment every second once the page has loaded.</li>
  <li>As a user, I can manually increment and decrement the counter using the plus and minus buttons.</li>
  <li>As a user, I can 'like' an individual number of the counter. I should see count of the number of 'likes' associated with that number.</li>
  <li>As a user, I can pause the counter, which should 
      <ul>
          <li>pause the counter</li>
          <li>disable all buttons except the pause button</li>
          <li>the pause button should then show the text "resume."</li>
      </ul>
      When 'resume' is clicked, it should restart the counter and re-enable the buttons.</li>
    <li>As a user, I can leave comments on my gameplay, such as: "Wow, what a fun game this is."</li>
</ol>
